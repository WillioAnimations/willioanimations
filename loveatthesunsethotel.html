	<p id="summary"> Two families arrive at the same hotel and instantly become distasteful of each other. The promise of a relaxing vacation to escape their pressures at home seems impossible, until two of the teenagers find themselves stuck at the hotel away from their families. A romance sparks between them-one they must hide from their families. Their infatuations become love, despite their challenging circumstances, and they must find a way to take their romance home with them. </p>
