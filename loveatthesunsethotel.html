	<p id="summary"> Two families arrive at the same hotel and instantly become distasteful of each other. The promise of a relaxing vacation seems impossible, until two of the teenagers find themselves stuck at the hotel, alone. A romance sparks between them-one that must stay a secret. Their infatuations become love, despite challenging circumstances, and they must find a way to take their romance back home. </p>
